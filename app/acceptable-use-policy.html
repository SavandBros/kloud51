      ll users must comply with all relevant legislation and regulations on bulk and commercial e-mail,
      including but not limited to the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003.
    </p>
    <p>
      Users may not send mass unsolicited e-mail, which is email that is sent to recipients who have not "opted-in" to
      mailings from the user. Users who send mass mailings must maintain complete and accurate records of all consents
      and opt-ins and provide such records to Kloud51 upon its request. If a user cannot provide positive and verifiable
      proof of such consents and opt-ins, we will consider the mass mailing to be unsolicited. Users are prohibited from
      operating mailing lists, listservs, or mailing services that do not target an audience that has voluntarily signed
      up for e-mail information using an "opt-in" process or that has made their e-mail addresses available to a user for
      distribution of information. Users who operate mailing lists must maintain complete and accurate records of all
      consents and "opt-in" elections and provide such records to Kloud51 upon its request. If a user cannot provide
      positive and verifiable proof of such consents and "opt-in" elections, we will consider the list mailing to be
      unsolicited. Any user-maintained mailing list must also allow any party on the list to remove itself
      automatically and permanently. Other prohibited activities include, without limitation, the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>use of our network for the receipt of replies to unsolicited mass e-mail;</p></li>
      <li><p>forgery of e-mail headers (spoofing);</p></li>
      <li>
        <p>spamming via third-party proxy, aggregation of proxy lists, or installation of proxy mailing software;</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          configuration of a mail server to accept and process third-party messages for sending without user
          identification and authentication;
        </p>
      </li>
      <li><p>hosting web pages advertised within "spam e-mail" sent from another network (spamvertising);</p></li>
      <li><p>hosting web pages or providing services that support spam;</p></li>
      <li>
        <p>
          any other unsolicited bulk messages, postings, or transmissions through media such as weblog posts,
          IRC/chat room messages, guestbook entries, HTTP referrer log entries, usenet posts, pop-up messages,
          instant messages, or SMS messages; and
        </p>
      </li>
      <li><p>instructing others in any activity prohibited by this AUP.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If, as a result of your actions, our mail servers or IP address ranges are placed on black hole lists or other
      mail filtering software systems, your VPS may be suspended and possibly terminated upon review. If we deem your
      account at risk for repeated AUP infractions, we may suspend and/or terminate all VPSs on it.

          Although we have the ability to absorb and tolerate occasional DDoS attacks, clients who have not purchased
          our optional DDoS filtering and who are targeted with frequent and/or disruptive attacks may be suspended
          and/or terminated. In addition, we do not allow port scanning or UDP floods to be sent from our network.
          Accounts sending floods, port scanning, and/or creating artificial traffic will be suspended and/or
          terminated. If your VPS is found to be degrading the connection speed of other VPSs, you will be notified via
          ticket and asked to reduce your usage.
