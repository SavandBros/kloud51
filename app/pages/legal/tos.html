    <!-- Detail -->
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Storage and Plan Limits.</b> All Web Hosting and WordPress Hosting plans, including the unlimited plans, are
        subject to a limit of no more than 250,000 inodes per account for Linux® hosting accounts or 500,000 files
        and folders per account for Windows® hosting accounts. The plans are also limited to no more than 1,000 tables
        per database and no more than one gigabyte of storage per database. Any account or database that exceeds these
        limits may be issued a network violation warning and will be required to reduce the number of inodes, files and
        folders, tables or gigabytes (as the case may be), or may be temporarily or permanently suspended, in our sole
        discretion. All Linux hosting plans are subject to the following limitations: no more than a) 25% of one CPU
        core; b) 512MB of RAM; c) 100 website connections; d) 100 active processes; e) 1 MB/s disk IO. 
        In the event these limitations are exceeded, your site may slow down or not be served until more resources are
        added.  More resources may be added for additional fees.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Website/Server Content.</b> Your website may not include any of the following content: (1) image hosting
        scripts that allow an anonymous user to upload an image for display on another website (similar to Photobucket
        or Tinypic); (2) banner ad services for display on other websites or devices (commercial banner ad rotation);
        (3) file dump/mirror scripts that allow an anonymous user to upload a file for other to download (similar to
        rapidshare); (4) commercial audio streaming (more than one or two streams); (5) push button mail scripts that
        allow the user to specify recipient email addresses; (6) anonymous or bulk SMS gateways; (7) backups of content
        from another computer or website; (8) Bittorrent trackers; or (9) any script that causes a degradation in the
        performance of our server or network environment.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Unlimited Disk Space/Bandwidth/Website Plans.</b> Web Hosting plans are designed to host most personal,
        small business and organization websites, and thus we offer unlimited bandwidth and some plans offer unlimited
        disk space and websites. This means that we do not set a limit on the amount of bandwidth, websites or disk
        space you may use in the operation of your website, provided it complies with this Agreement. In the event the
        bandwidth, number of websites or disk space usage of your website presents a risk to the stability, performance
        or uptime of our servers, data storage, networking or other infrastructure, you may be required to upgrade to a
        VPS or Dedicated Server, or we may take action to restrict the resources your website is utilizing.

  <h1 class="title-header">Service Uptime Guarantee</h1>
  <hr>
  <!-- Detail -->
  <p>
    We offer a Service uptime guarantee of 99.9% (“Service Uptime Guarantee”) of available time per month.
    If we fail to maintain this Service Uptime Guarantee in a particular month (as solely determined by us),
    you may contact us and request a credit of 5% of your monthly hosting fee for that month. The credit may be
    used only for the purchase of further products and services from us, and is exclusive of any applicable taxes.
    The Service Uptime Guarantee does not apply to service interruptions caused by: (1) periodic scheduled maintenance
    or repairs we may undertake from time to time; (2) interruptions caused by you from custom scripting, coding or
    the installation of third-party applications; (3) outages that do not affect the appearance of your website but
    merely affect access to your website such as FTP and email; (4) causes beyond our control or that are not reasonably
    foreseeable; and (5) outages related to the reliability of certain programming environments.
