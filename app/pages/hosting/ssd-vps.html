            <h3>When Should I Move To A Virtual Server?</h3>
            <p>
              If you’re outgrowing your web hosting or simply want more control, a managed or fully managed VPS (Virtual
              Private Server) is the next logical choice for your hosting needs.
            </p>
            <p>
              It gives you more freedom with SSH Access to Apache and PHP, plus you can install an SSL certificate, as
              well as any type of software – all without the responsibility of a physical dedicated server.
            </p>
            <p>
              On a shared server, you rely on the performance of the platform provided.
            </p>
            <p>
              By choosing for VPS, you get to select a configuration best suited for your applications, requirements and
              growth.

            <h3>What Is A VPS Used For?</h3>
            <p>
              A VPS allows you to host sites (storefront, e-commerce, content, media) and software applications
              (primarily web: portal, extranet, collaborative solutions, wiki, CRM) with ease.
            </p>
            <p>
              Unlike shared hosting, it allows multiple applications to be isolated from one another within the same
              container.
            </p>
            <p>
              While this VPS container shares physical resources (infrastructure) with other containers, its resources
              are dedicated to you.

            <h3>How Do I Upgrade My Vps?</h3>
            <p>
              You can upgrade your VPS at any time, directly from your control panel. Your entire system (OS, software,
              settings) is saved; you don't need to make any changes. Once you select a plan, upgrading happens
              automatically within minutes.

            <h3>Who Can Use A Vps?</h3>
            <p>
              Anybody with some technical skills; this is especially true for managed VPS. Required admin skills include
              access, file transfer, and configuration. We continue to develop more tools and features that will make it
              even easier to manage your server environment.
