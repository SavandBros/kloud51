              way of you getting your website up and your content out there. WordPress is built to make that happen.

              Your blog is your home, and comments provide a space for your friends and followers to engage with your
              content. WordPress’s comment tools give you everything you need to be a forum for discussion and to

              create Posts and Pages, format them easily, insert media, and with the click of a button your content is

              WordPress is available in more than 70 languages. If you or the person you’re building the website for
              would prefer to use WordPress in a language other than English, that’s easy to do.

              WordPress has always been easy to install and upgrade. If you’re happy using an FTP program, you can
              create a database, upload WordPress using FTP, and run the installer. Not familiar with FTP? Plenty of web
              hosts offer one-click WordPress installers that let you install WordPress with, well, just one click!

              WordPress makes it easy for you to manage your content. Create drafts, schedule publication, and look at
              your post revisions. Make your content public or private, and secure posts and pages with a password.

              Not everyone requires the same access to your website. Administrators manage the site, editors work with
              content, authors and contributors write that content, and subscribers have a profile that they can manage.
              This lets you have a variety of contributors to your website, and let others simply be part of your
              community.

              about to shut down? WordPress comes with importers for blogger, LiveJournal, Movable Type, TypePad, Tumblr

            <p>
              They say a picture says a thousand words, which is why it’s important for you to be able to quickly and
              easily upload images and media to WordPress. Drag and drop your media into the uploader to add it to your
              website. Add alt text, captions, and titles, and insert images and galleries into your content. We’ve even
              added a few image editing tools you can have fun with.

              Hosted services come and go. If you’ve ever used a service that disappeared, you know how traumatic that
              can be. If you’ve ever seen adverts appear on your website, you’ve probably been pretty annoyed. Using
              WordPress means no one has access to your content. Own your data, all of it — your website, your content,
              your data.

              Every piece of WordPress generated code is in full compliance with the standards set by the W3C. This
              means that your website will work in today’s browser, while maintaining forward compatibility with the

              WordPress comes bundled with two default themes, but if they aren’t for you there’s a theme directory with
              thousands of themes for you to create a beautiful website. None of those to your taste? Upload your own
              theme with the click of a button. It only takes a few seconds for you to give your website a complete

              The WordPress APIs make it possible for you to create plugins to extend WordPress. WordPress’s
              extensibility lies in the thousands of hooks at your disposal. Once you’ve created your plugin, we’ve even
              got a plugin repository for you to host it on.

              extensibility to create themes as simple or as complex as you wish. If you want to give your theme away
              for free you can give it to users in the Theme Repository.

            <h3>Custom Content Types</h3>
            <p>
              WordPress comes with default content types, but for more flexibility you can add a few lines of code to
              create your own custom post types, taxonomies, and metadata. Take WordPress in whatever direction you
              wish.
