      <a href="https://kloud51.com/register.php">Signup to our affiliate program</a>,
      it's quick and free (existing customers don't need to do this).
      <br>
      Put a link (such as <em>https://kloud51.com/aff.php?aff=your_account_id</em>) on your web-site.
      <br>
      Visitors to your site click on that link, come to our site and signup for one of our hosting accounts.
      We register that new customer as one of your referrals.
      <br>
      Each month we send you 20% of what your referrals spent with us during the previous month.
      The money can be sent to your PayPal account or credited to your Kloud51 account as a in-store credit.
